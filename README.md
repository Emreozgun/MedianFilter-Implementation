# Median Filter Implementation with different ordering methods

> Salt-and-pepper noise is a form of noise sometimes seen on images. It is also known as impulse noise. This noise can be caused by sharp and sudden disturbances in the image signal. It presents itself as sparsely occurring white and black pixels.

An effective noise reduction method for this type of noise is a **median filter** or a morphological filter.I have been implemented median filter with three different ordering methods.These are Lexicographical ordering, Bitmix ordering and Norm based ordering.The median filter run through each element of the signal (in this case the image) and replace each pixel with the median of its neighboring pixels (located in a square neighborhood around the evaluated pixel).I want to observe different methods on median filter and comparing these.

## Installation

- All the `code` required to get started

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/Emreozgun/myShell.git`
- Then open the terminal and go to the directory where the file is located.
- Run with **make all && ./gtushell** 


## Features
  ### Lexicographical ordering 
  >My shell support the following commands:
  ### Bitmix ordering
  >which will list file type (R for regular file, S for non-regular(special) file), access rights (int the
  form of rwxr-xr-x, just like actual ls), file size(bytes) and file name of all files (not directories) in
  the present working directory. It doesnâ€™t take any argument. Does not list any directory.
  ### Norm based ordering
  > which will print the path of present working directory.
